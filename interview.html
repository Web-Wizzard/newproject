          <h5 class="card-title">1.What is C language?</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            C is a mid-level and procedural programming language. The Procedural programming language is also known as the structured programming language is a technique in which large programs are broken down into smaller modules, and each module uses structured code. This technique minimizes error and misinterpretation.

          <p class="card-text">
            C is known as a mother language because most of the compilers and JVMs are written in C language. Most of the languages which are developed after C language has borrowed heavily from it like C++, Python, Rust, javascript, etc. It introduces new core concepts like arrays, functions, file handling which are used in these languages.

          <p class="card-text">
            C is called a mid-level programming language because it binds the low level and high -level programming language. We can use C language as a System programming to develop the operating system as well as an Application programming to generate menu driven customer driven billing system.

          <p class="card-text">
            o	Simple: C is a simple language because it follows the structured approach, i.e., a program is broken into parts <br>
o	Portable: C is highly portable means that once the program is written can be run on any machine with little or no modifications. <br>
o	Mid Level: C is a mid-level programming language as it combines the low- level language with the features of the high-level language. <br>
o	Structured: C is a structured language as the C program is broken into parts. <br>
o	Fast Speed: C language is very fast as it uses a powerful set of data types and operators. <br>
o	Memory Management: C provides an inbuilt memory function that saves the memory and improves the efficiency of our program. <br>
o	Extensible: C is an extensible language as it can adopt new features in the future.

          <p class="card-text">
            Following are the uses of a static variable: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;o	A variable which is declared as static is known as a static variable. The static variable retains its value between multiple function calls. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;o	Static variables are used because the scope of the static variable is available in the entire program. So, we can access a static variable anywhere in the program. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;o	The static variable is initially initialized to zero. If we update the value of a variable, then the updated value is assigned. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;o	The static variable is used as a common value which is shared by all the methods. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;o	The static variable is initialized only once in the memory heap to reduce the memory usage.

&nbsp;&nbsp; o	C functions are used to avoid the rewriting the same code again and again in our program. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; o	C functions can be called any number of times from any place of our program.
&nbsp;&nbsp; o	When a program is divided into functions, then any part of our program can easily be tracked. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; o	C functions provide the reusability concept, i.e., it breaks the big task into smaller tasks so that it makes the C program more understandable

            Arrays are of two types: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o	One-dimensional array: One-dimensional array is an array that stores the elements one after the another. <br>

            <p class="card-text">
              A pointer is a variable that refers to the address of a value. It makes the code optimized and makes the performance fast. Whenever a variable is declared inside a program, then the system allocates some memory to a variable. The memory contains some address number. The variables that hold this address number is known as the pointer variable.

              o	Accessing array elements: Pointers are used in traversing through an array of integers and strings. The string is an array of characters which is terminated by a null character '\0'. <br>
o	Dynamic memory allocation: Pointers are used in allocation and deallocation of memory during the execution of a program. <br>
o	Call by Reference: The pointers are used to pass a reference of a variable to other function. <br>
o	Data Structures like a tree, graph, linked list, etc.: The pointers are used to construct different data structures like tree, graph, linked list, etc. <br>

            <p class="card-text">
              1.	malloc() <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	The malloc() function is used to allocate the memory during the execution of the program. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	It does not initialize the memory but carries the garbage value. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	It returns a null pointer if it could not be able to allocate the requested space. <br>
Syntax: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.	ptr = (cast-type*) malloc(byte-size)  <br> <br>

2.	calloc() <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	The calloc() is same as malloc() function, but the difference only is that it initializes the memory with zero value. <br>
Syntax: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.	ptr = (cast-type*)calloc(n, element-size); <br> <br>

3.	realloc() <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	The realloc() function is used to reallocate the memory to the new size. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	If sufficient space is not available in the memory, then the new block is allocated to accommodate the existing data. <br>
Syntax: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.	ptr = realloc(ptr, newsize); <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the above syntax, ptr is allocated to a new size. <br><br>
4.	free(): <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	The free() function releases the memory allocated by either calloc() or malloc() function. <br>
Syntax: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.	free(ptr); <br>

The local variables are also known as an auto variable. It is optional to use an auto keyword before the data type of a variable. If no value is stored in the local variable, then it consists of a garbage value.

Thus, even if a header file with proper syntax is included twice, the second one will get ignored.

              Modular programming is an approach that focuses on dividing an entire program into independent and interchangeable modules or sub-programs, such as functions and modules for achieving the desired functionality. It separates the functionality in such a manner that each sub-program contains everything necessary to execute just one aspect of the desired functionality.

              As the name suggests, a sequential access file is used to store files sequentially, i.e. one data is placed into one file after another. It means that if you have to access files you will have to check each file sequentially (reading one data at a time) until your desired file is reached. It is more limitations as access time will be very high and storage cost is high.

              Preprocessor programs provide preprocessor directives that tell the compiler to preprocess the source code before compiling. All of these preprocessor directives begin with a ‘#’ (hash) symbol. The ‘#’ symbol indicates that whatever statement starts with a ‘#’ will go to the preprocessor program to get executed. We can place these preprocessor directives anywhere in our program. <br>

Examples of some preprocessor directives are: #include, #define, #ifndef, etc. <br>
